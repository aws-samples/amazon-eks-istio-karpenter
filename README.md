## Optimize AZ traffic costs using EKS, Karpenter and Istio

Enterprises utilizing Amazon EKS often struggle with certain challenges that hinder their pursuit of operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Prominent among these challenges are the costs incurred from cross Availability Zone (AZ) traffic, difficulties in achieving seamless scalability, hurdles in provisioning right-sized instances for nodes, and intricacies in managing service networking via topology-aware load balancing. These hurdles not only elevate operational costs but also pose a threat to achieving high availability and efficient scaling of resources. This aims to present a robust solution using Istio, Karpenter, and Amazon EKS together to directly address the mentioned challenges and pain points. The proposed solution intends to provide a roadmap towards optimizing Cross AZ traffic costs, ensuring high availability in a cost-optimized manner, and promoting efficient scaling of the underlying compute resources.
